# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio page on GitHub to showcase some of the projects I have participated in. The list is growing as more clearances come in for certain projects or files in projects that might contain custom code I have created while working on the project. Enjoy!

# 📁 GitHub Repositories

## 🔹 **FloorPlan-Automatic-Vectorizer (Private)**  
**Repo:** *(Private — not publicly available)*  

**Description:**  
A sophisticated capstone project for fully automated **2D floor plan vectorization**. Combines state-of-the-art object detection with creative geometric algorithms. Key capabilities:  
- YOLO-based detection of **walls, doors, and windows** using the newest large model  
- Tiled high-resolution processing for large floor plans  
- Global reconstruction to merge detections into a unified layout  
- Automatic extraction of **room boundaries + room area computation**  
- Outputs vectorized floor plan layers for downstream CAD workflows

## 🔹 **Arabic-Dialect-Identification**  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AmrSamerBa/Arabic-Dialect-Identification  

**Description:**  
A complete ML system for **spoken Arabic dialect classification**. Utilizes audio preprocessing and spectrogram-based CNNs to classify dialects across various Arabic-speaking regions. Includes:  
- Audio preprocessing + MFCC/spectrogram generation  
- CNN-based dialect classifier  
- Training, evaluation, and confusion matrix scripts  
- Dataset cleaning and augmentation utilities

## 🔹 **Anime-Diffusion-SuperResolution**  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AmrSamerBa/Anime-Diffusion-SuperResolution  

**Description:**  
A high-resolution **anime remastering and super-resolution** pipeline using a diffusion-based UNet architecture and CLIP-powered low-resolution encoders. Features include:  
- 480p (and higher) → 1080p (can be higher) anime frame upscaling  
- Custom dataset sharding, cropping, and batching  
- Distributed multi-GPU training (A100, 5090, etc.)  
- Evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS)  
- EMA training loop, validation set extraction, and inference scripts

## 🔹 **Quantum-QAOA-Noise2Clean**  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AmrSamerBa/Quantum-QAOA-Noise2Clean  

**Description:**  
A novel quantum-classical hybrid project focused on **denoising QAOA Max-Cut circuit outputs**. This repo includes:  
- A generator for noisy vs. ideal bitstring distributions  
- Use of IBM FakeBackends (FakeNairobi, FakeLagos, FakeBrisbane, etc.)  
- Collection of hardware metadata (T1/T2, readout error, gate error)  
- A neural-network-based histogram correction model  
- Visualizations of noise trends and QAOA performance degradation

## 🔹 **NLLB-Advanced-Text-Summarization**  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AmrSamerBa/NLLB-Advanced-Text-Summarization  

**Description:**  
An advanced multilingual summarization project built on Meta AI’s **NLLB (No Language Left Behind)** transformer. This repository includes:  
- Abstractive summarization fine-tuning  
- Multilingual dataset preprocessing  
- Inference pipelines for long-form text  
- Evaluation against baseline summarizers  
- Experiments on cross-lingual and low-resource summarization
